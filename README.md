In this project, we will be building a basic recipe website.  It will be compiling some of my favorite recipes.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills I have learned:
    1. Creating headings and paragraphs
    2. Creating links to other websites/pages
    3. Adding images to a webpage
    4. Practicing using Git/GitHub
